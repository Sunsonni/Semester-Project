Created in an Angular frontend with a PHP backend and Postgresql as the database.
This project uses the Gemini AI API therefore to get started you will need an API key.
TODO: Figure out how to make process easier. 


DATABASE:
    Initially used MySQL but used to postgres.
    Already had pgAdmin4 in computer and installed postgres app. 
    Created postgres database and had to convert all the mysql pdo expressions to ones that work with postgres. Set up tables and teacher_user for use for backend. 
ANGULAR/FRONTEND:
    Always decided to use Angular as I have some previous experience in it. Several components created along with services that actually hit the REST API. AUTH guard as well to prevent user from getting to other pages before they are authorized.
    An admin user is allowed to delete users 
    //TODO: Add more functionality for admin users.  
    //TODO: Make it so a user is automatically 'user' unless changed to admin by a admin user. 



Put Backend folder in htdocs folder of MAMP.
Start MAMP server.
